# Node gRPC server reflection

At this time, there is no 'official' `@grpc/grpc-js` package that implements reflection. See more [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md#known-implementations).

> **NOTE**: Various non-@grpc/grpc-js packages do exist - however, some are not maintained and/or not widely used.
